    "### Integrated Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated Gradients is a technique for attributing a classification model's prediction to its input features. It is a model interpretability technique: you can use it to visualize the relationship between input features and model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated Gradients is a variation on computing the gradient of the prediction output with regard to features of the input. To compute integrated gradients, we need to perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the input and the output. In our case, the input is an image and the output is the last layer of our model (dense layer with softmax activation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute which features are important to a neural network when making a prediction on a particular data point. To identify these features, we need to choose a baseline input. A baseline input can be a black image (all pixel values set to zero) or random noise. The shape of the baseline input needs to be the same as our input image, e.g. (299, 299, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpolate the baseline for a given number of steps. The number of steps represents the steps we need in the gradient approximation for a given input image. The number of steps is a hyperparameter. The authors recommend using anywhere between 20 and 1000 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocess these interpolated images and do a forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get the gradients for these interpolated images.\n",
    "- Approximate the gradients integral using the trapezoidal rule."
